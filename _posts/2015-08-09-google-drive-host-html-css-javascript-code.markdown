Google gives us fantastic way to host client side languages like HTML, CSS and Javascript code to Google drive. Yes it is free of cost. Normally, we can run HTML, CSS and JavaScript languages in our browser directly, we don't need to install any server software in our operating system. But when you reference anywhere on internet, then you can't add your folder path, you need to host into internet, so everyone can access it. 

There are plenty of way, to host your static code in internet, but in this tutorial, I will use Google Drive. so let's start. Here I will host 4 things, 
profile.jpg, myjavascript.js, mystyle.css and mywebpage.html

## Host HTML, CSS and JavaScript code to Google Drive. ##

1. Save your HTML, CSS and JavaScript code into your favorite text editor with proper extension, and place theme into one folder. if you want to host only one file then you don't need to create folder, but in general purpose, it is good practive to make it folder, so in future, you can add other codes into that.
3. Now upload that folder or file to Google drive, you can use drop and drag functionality, or Download Google Drive application for your MAC or PC. So you can easily change your codes into your own text editor, otherwise you need to use third party app, that will required permission to handle your Google drive files, So I suggest to you download Google Drive apps, it is easy to use, and easy to synchronize between computer and Google drive.
4. After successfully, uploaded files, in your Google drive, let's make it whole folder as public, so everyone can access it, If you did not make public folder, then your files will not be accessible by browser, and you will not get the proper result. Don't worry, your files will not be edited by anyone, until you don't wont, they can only view.
5. Now get the links, of your files. You can not use this link to reference, because it will open the Google Docs folder.
6. Now get the ID, of file.
7. Now, use that ID, in this URL.
8. Bingo, you hosted, your files successfully in Google Drive. Now you can reference that link anywhere, as you like.
