Google Search Engine work with these three phases.

1)	Crawling

2)	Indexing

3)	Ranking

## What is crawling? ##

You can assume crawling as scanning. Generally Googlebot get the necessary information from your site like some text, media or files. You can also use Robots.txt to prevent crawling into specific directory. 

Crawling is done in three ways. First one is by submitting a sitemap to Google Webmaster Tools, Second one is to ping URL to webmaster tools and third one is automatically by using links.

As per my advice you should link all the web pages in a proper way, just like Wikipedia does, it will help to crawl your website better, and better. So whenever you changed something in your webpage, it will quickly change into the search results.

## What is Indexing? ##
When crawling is done by Googlebot, Google start Indexing crawled web pages into the search result.  

Google displays a rich snippet if the structure data is well formatted with schema tags. As per my opinion you should use rich snippet in your webpage, currently I am using breadcrumbs.  

## What is ranking? ##
No one will be ranked, always on TOP. Google changes its algorithm to display high quality web pages on the first page to satisfy the user query. Google uses 200 + signals to find out best web pages as per user query.
