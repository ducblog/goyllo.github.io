Many of the beginner and spammer, always ask this question on the Google Blogger help forum, *"why my blog is deleted by Blogger team"*. Actually, they will notify you, in your email address, whenever they delete your blogger blog. And they deleted your blog because you did not follow their <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/41935?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"> TOS </a>and <a href="http://www.blogger.com/content.g?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Policy</a>. So here I post some of basic reason of deletion of blogger blog.

In starting, your blog does not get much traffic from anywhere. So the blogger team does not have any complaints or notice about your blog. But when you start driving more traffic from search engines or from social media or anywhere, then many of people will see your blog. If they notice, you are not using blogger platform legally, then they complaint your blog to Google. So the Blogger team manually check your blog, if they find you are misusing blogger platform, then they will delete your blog, and you have only a few chances to get it back again. Also, many times, blogs are automatically deleted for spamming reason, and they use some automation technique like bots (Googlebot). And here I will tell you what you should not use in your blogger blog, so you will be safe.

## Don’t create too many blogs that look like spam ##

If you did any mistake, and your blog is deleted, then you are going to create another one but don’t do that, instead create another Google account with real name and profile and start blogging seriously. In short, if you’re many of the blogs, deleted automatically, and does not recovered yet, then you should stop to creating another blog on the same account.

## Don’t redirect your blogger blog ##

Many of advertising ads and some JavaScript code, redirect your blogger blog to another URL like doorway pages or affiliate programming offers. Use Fetch as Google option from Google Webmaster Tools, to check out your blog redirection. If it is redirected, then Googlebot, surely inform your blog to the Blogger platform, and your blog will be shut down.

## Don’t Use spam links in the blog post ##

Many of people mentions any type of links in their post without using the nofollow attributes. If you are not using <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/96569?hl=en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" >nofollow</a> attributes, then Google will crawl that page, and if they find you are mention the paid links in your post, or spam links in your post, then they will inform to blogger platform, and your blog will be shut down.

## Don’t Use Third party ads in sidebar ##

I know getting AdSense on another topic is really tough. But don’t use third party ads, which display abuse ads, and gives poor user experience in your blog.

## Don’t Use hate speech in your blog post ##

I know Many of Governments (Like Indian) gives you the freedom to talk freely in cyberspace. But Google blogger doesn’t give you. So whenever you post any articles it should be user friendly.

## Don’t Use, Copyright content in your blog post ##
Many of bloggers directly embed images, videos and files (cracked software+hacked content) in their post without checking its license first. Also, some spammer copy paste someone articles on their post. Yes, you will not penalize immediately, but when you start driving more and more traffic to your blog, your chances of deletion will also increase.

At last, I want to say. Only those, **high traffic blogs have been running for a long time, which are doing blogging with genuine way**. And all others are deleted after some time.
