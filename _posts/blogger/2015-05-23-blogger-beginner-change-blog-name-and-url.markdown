<h3>Some tips while modifying blogger/BlogSpot address.</h3>
Well, if you already made own blog and posted many things in your blog, then Google automatically index your post in search results. To clarify just open Google and type your blog address like this “Site: goyllo.blogspot.com” without the quotes (Don’t forgot to change Goyllo to your name). Then there you will see your posted content.

Now when you change/edit your blog address to some other name, and visitors come through search results or from somewhere like social media or any other website that is pointed your blog URL, then they will see 404 error i.e. Content is not available for this page. Yes, it’s harmful for your blog if your blog displays many 404 errors to visitors and search engine spider.
