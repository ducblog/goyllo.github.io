Creating your first blog on blogger, it's very easy just visit blogger.com and enter your blog name, address name (URL) and any template as you like, don't worry if by mistake you choose anythingâ€™s wrong, you can easily change all the things in later.

I hope you already made your own blog with blogger, now lets me clarify something about blogger platform.

Blogger own by Google, so you must follow its <a href="http://www.blogger.com/content.g?hl=en" rel="nofollow">policy</a> and <a href="https://support.google.com/blogger/answer/41935?hl=en" rel="nofollow">TOS </a>. If you did not follow and posting anything abuse, then your blog will be <a href="/blogger/beginner/blog-delete-reason/">deleted</a> automatically from blogger team. Yes, you can make requests to restore it, but very few blogs are restored by blogger team. 

There are many limitations on blogger, but nothing is unlimited in this world.
