Hello, friends, In this topic I will just mention some of example about competition, that may be you will liked it.

The competition is made by people like you, who always compare him/her self to other and they are only focus on real time market, nothing else, so if some products work great at this time, then you can see 10 other similar products in next months, because it is easy to make, and more profitable. 

For example, in many years ago, there are only one product for energy drink in India, and it was complain boy(2007), so at that time, that product is going rapidly very high, but after few months, there are tons off product similar just like that, just because there are easy to make, and it's more profitable than any. 

Now let's take an example of kayamchuran, it is the only on product for health, who have almost zero competitions, because everybody, know it, we can't get much profit from that, because our competitors are doing very great job, and that might be we can't. Similarly, whenever you make any thing for world, then do your hard work on that, so your competitors, see. OMG, this guy is doing very hard work on this product, we can't beat him. 

There are also other thing you should remember, may be many of people
