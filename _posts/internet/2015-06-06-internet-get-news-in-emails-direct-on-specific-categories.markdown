A Google Alert is one of the amazing products of <a href="/google/">Google</a> Company, it will help to get specific news on any topic, directly to the Gmail inbox.

Many times, you need to some alert news in your email without surfing to the internet. For example. Here, I use Google alert for this topic "Zero Day Exploit"
